      <h2>BUILDING A TEAM AND DECK</h2>
      <p>All character cards and some battle cards have a number of stars near the bottom of the cards. Make sure the total number of stars on your character cards and battle cards combined is 25 or less.</p>
      <p>As long as you don’t go over the 25-star limit, you can have as many characters on your team as you want...</p>

      <h2>WINNING THE GAME</h2>
      <p>When your opponent’s characters are all KO’d (knocked out), you win!</p>

      <h2>GETTING STARTED</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Put your characters on your side of the battlefield in alt mode...</li>
        <li>Shuffle your deck of battle cards. Put it face down off to the side.</li>
        <li>Randomly decide who goes first...</li>
        <li>Each player draws 3 battle cards...</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>TAPPING AND UNTAPPING CHARACTERS</h2>
      <p>If you’re told to tap one of your characters, turn it sideways...</p>

      <h2>TAKING A TURN</h2>
      <p>At the start of your turn, draw a battle card. Then you can do the following in any order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flip 1 of your characters to its other mode.</li>
        <li>Play 1 Action card from your hand.</li>
        <li>Play 1 Upgrade card from your hand onto one of your characters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Exception: On the very first turn of the game...</p>
      <p>When you play an Action, do what the card says...</p>

      <h2>ATTACK</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose one of your untapped characters as the attacker.</li>
        <li>Choose one of your opponent’s tapped characters as the defender...</li>
        <li>Tap your attacker.</li>
        <li>Each player flips over the top 2 battle cards...</li>
        <li>For the attacker, count orange icons...</li>
        <li>For the defender, count blue icons...</li>
        <li>Compare numbers and assign damage if applicable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>DAMAGE AND KNOCKOUT</h2>
      <p>When something does damage to a character, put that many damage counters on it...</p>

      <h2>RESHUFFLING YOUR DECK</h2>
      <p>If your deck ever runs out of battle cards, shuffle the cards in your scrap pile face down...</p>
